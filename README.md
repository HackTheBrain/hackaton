# Hackaton

Here we present patches which you can use as a preset for your work on this Hackathon. All patches are created in OpenVibe with some additional python scripts. OpenVibe is an open source software for BCI and online EEG processing. Since it is open source you are free to make any changes and upgrades both in the code or/and in the structure of the patches. Information, download files and tutorials on OpenVibe you will find here http://openvibe.inria.fr/. For use these patches (as well as for use any hardware and software for BCI) you ought to know some basic things about EEG. Electroencephalography (EEG) is an electrophysiological monitoring method to record electrical activity of the brain. The source of this activity is synchronous work of millions neurons in the brain cortex. Each area of the cortes is considered to response for it’s own function, that’s why it is very important to place electrodes on their right position. Most of people working with EEG use 10-20 international system for EEG electrodes placement. More detailed you can read about it here https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/10-20_system_(EEG). Although commercial EEG devices (such as Muse, Emotive etc.) don’t allow you to place electrodes as accurate as professional ones do, you still have to mind the position of your device on the subject’s head.
In the wiki folder you will find short description on every patches we provide here. Good luck!
