Alpha waves are neural oscillations in the frequency range from 7 to 13 Hz. Difference in alpha power between frontal lobes is considered to reference emotions that the person experiences at the present moment. Roughly, if the power of alpha waves is greater on the right side, it means that he/she feels positive emotions, vice versa - negative emotions.
Why so? It’s believed that right and left frontal lobes play different roles in production of emotions in human. Activity in the right lobe is considered to correlate with negative emotions (more precisely - with avoidance motivation) , in the left lobe - positive (more precisely - with approach motivation). The greater alpha waves are the lower level of activation of given cortex structure is, thus, if we measure greater alpha activity, for example, on the right side in comparison with the left side, we can say that left side is more active and the subject, probably, experiences positive emotions.
How to use this patch? 
Open OpenVibe.
Load “Alpha_Asymetry.xml” patch.
Connect your (Mitsar) EEG device to the computer.
Choose the correct port (xxxx) in your device settings.
Wear your EEG device
Push “Start” button on the top bar of OpenVibe
You can monitor an emotional state in different ways using boxes from “Visualisation” folder from the right column.
What’s happening there?
This patch gets EEG record or EEG live stream, then chooses a signal only from frontal electrodes (F3 - left, F4 - right), makes filtering leaving only required frequency (in our case it’s alpha waves which are 7-13 Hz). On the next stage the difference in frequency power between left and right is being measured and the program displays the result as intensity of red color. The greater this difference is the more saturated color we can see.
Suggestions on this patch. Information you can get from this patch is very useful for neuroart, because, potentially, it gives you an access to the one of the most important features of the mental state - dominance motivation and consequential gives you a possibility to generate any pieces of art (music, pictures etc.) in correspondence with subject’s unconscious motivation dominance.
