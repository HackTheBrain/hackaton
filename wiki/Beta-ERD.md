Beta-ERD

Beta waves are the EEG waves in the range from 13 to 30 Hz. Beta ERD (Event Related Desynchronization) is a phenomen of the reducing of beta waves
power in responce to some external or internal event. The well known example of such a desynchronisation that we use in our patch is
reducing of beta waves power in a sensorymotor cortex during movement execution. For example if the subject moves his/her right hand we will 
observe beta desynchronisation in parietal area of the left hemishere (C3, P3). The good news is that the desynchronisation occurs not only
in response to real movement but also when the subject only imagine movement performance and even when observes movements of another person. There are also evidences that desynchronization can 
occur not only for beta but also for alpha rythm, so you can try to remake the patch using alpha waves instead of beta.
How to use this patch?
Connect your EEG device to the computer.
OpenVibe Acqusition server is a center node, that collects data from devices of different types. Launch OpenVibe Acqusition server and setup it for your EEG device. There could be several ways, that are described below.
Launch OpenVibe Designer.
Load “Beta-ERD.xml” patch.
There is an inital node "Aquisition client", that will connect to OpenVibe Acqusition server for device data.
Wear your EEG device
Push “Start” button on the top bar of OpenVibe
You can monitor an emotional state in different ways using boxes from “Visualisation” folder from the right column.
How to set up OpenVibe Acqusition server

Launch OpenVibe Acqusition server
Choose driver for your device to obtain data from it.
Or choose driver for LSLSmartbci (separate program) as another way of recieving data.
Press "Connect" for initialising connection to your device
Press "Run" to start recieving data
How to use LSLSmartbci for recieving data

Download folder with LSLSmartbci and install it. Download link: https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/0BwlufvWw_B4iLUpoVzlmMlZpUEk?usp=sharing
Installation for LSLSmartbci is simple. Install C++ RunTime files by launching vcredist_x64.exe 64 bit Windows or vcredist_x86.exe for 32 bit Windows from the downloaded floder. As C++ RunTime files are installed you could run LSLSmartbci.
Launch LSLSmartBCI. There are folders with two versions of LSLSmartbci in the downloaded folder: "LSL(1.0.7918)x64" for 64 bit Windows and "x86" for 32 bit Windows. Choose folder for your Windows and launch LSLSmartBCI.exe inside it.
