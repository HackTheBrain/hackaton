Beta-ERD

Beta waves are the EEG waves in the range from 13 to 30 Hz. Beta ERD (Event Related Desynchronization) is a phenomen of the reducing of beta waves
power in responce to some external or internal event. The well known example of such a desynchronisation that we use in our patch is
reducing of beta waves power in a sensorymotor cortex during movement execution. For example if the subject moves his/her right hand we will 
observe beta desynchronisation in parietal area of the left hemishere (C3, P3). The good news is that the desynchronisation occurs not only
in response to real movement but also when the subject only imagine movement performance and even when observes movements of another person. There are also evidences that desynchronization can 
occur not only for beta but also for alpha rythm, so you can try to remake the patch using alpha waves instead of beta.
