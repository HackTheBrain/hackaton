Creativity Patch


The most puzzling function of the human being is creativity - nobody actually knows what's happening while we are creating something new. That’s why it’s easy to understand that brain mechanisms underlying this process are extremely vague - there is no one clear hypothesis about it. However, after analyzing relevant literature, we’ve chosen one algorithm possibly suitable for the person’s creativity level estimation. We assess creativity in terms of connectivity level (in one of the frequency ranges) between distant cortex regions (e.g. frontal and occipital lobes). Using special math function we estimate synchronicity of waves in such regions. If these waves are synchronised, we propose that these regions are working together providing creativity function for the brain.
How to use this patch?

Connect your EEG device to the computer.
OpenVibe Acqusition server is a center node, that collects data from devices of different types. Launch OpenVibe Acqusition server and setup it for your EEG device. There could be several ways, that are described below.
Launch OpenVibe Designer.
Load “Creativity.xml” patch.
There is an inital node "Aquisition client", that will connect to OpenVibe Acqusition server for device data.
Wear your EEG device
Push “Start” button on the top bar of OpenVibe
You can monitor an emotional state in different ways using boxes from “Visualisation” folder from the right column.
How to set up OpenVibe Acqusition server

Launch OpenVibe Acqusition server
Choose driver for your device to obtain data from it.
Or choose driver for LSLSmartbci (separate program) as another way of recieving data.
Press "Connect" for initialising connection to your device
Press "Run" to start recieving data
How to use LSLSmartbci for recieving data

Download folder with LSLSmartbci and install it. Download link: https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/0BwlufvWw_B4iLUpoVzlmMlZpUEk?usp=sharing
Installation for LSLSmartbci is simple. Install C++ RunTime files by launching vcredist_x64.exe 64 bit Windows or vcredist_x86.exe for 32 bit Windows from the downloaded floder. 
As C++ RunTime files are installed you could run LSLSmartbci.
Launch LSLSmartBCI. There are folders with two versions of LSLSmartbci in the downloaded folder: "LSL(1.0.7918)x64" for 64 bit Windows and "x86" for 32 bit Windows. 
Choose folder for your Windows and launch LSLSmartBCI.exe inside it.


What’s happening there?

This patch gets data from EEG signal and compares connectivity between two selected channels (using built-in math function - for more information see box documentation). By default it’s frontal and occipital zones but you can choose other variants.
